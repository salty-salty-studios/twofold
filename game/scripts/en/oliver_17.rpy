    "After classes, I suddenly feel like I'm being followed. Who or why, I'm unsure, really."
    "It could be anyone at this point. It could be either of the two clubs' lackeys, or it could just be my imagination. Maybe Eileen's come to take revenge for Allison's project, or Tanya's going to extort me for lunch money, or something."
    "I don't know."
    "I'm trying to shake them by walking faster, but I swear I can hear their footsteps behind me still."

    "I speed up my pace, heading for a stairwell. I duck underneath it quick, then pop out once they've passed. Textbook \"ditch the bully\" tactic I learned back in middleschool."

    heather "Think about it. When have you ever come into a room filled with people who look excited to see you?"
    "I scowl, just out of instinct."
    heather "Exactly. Do you just think everyone in the writing club is just being nice because you're a new recruit? Especially after every little social faux pas that you've made along the way?"
    "I think I'd crumple if I was made of paper. No one can already know all that. She has to be fishing."

    heather "She whined during the club intentionally to indirectly give Tanya the idea to go get you. Tanya's a good person, but not exceptionally bright and equally predictable."
    heather "She asked us all to put on our best show so that you'd pick our little group of teamsters over Caprice's. She just wants to beat Caprice, who always has one over her."

    oliver "Why?"

    "Heather seems non-commital at best."
    heather "I'm just trying to help out. I figured you should know, before you go making choices based on an elaborate facade."
    oliver "Well, I guess you underestimated how much of a cynic I am. Why would you help me, right now?"
    "Maybe I just want to disagree with her because she seems so smug and self-assured all the time. This chick feels way more suspicious than how transparent Mekki and Caprice are being about my value to them."

    "I guess she's got my curiosity piqued, anyways."
    "Something clicks in my head."
    oliver "You were teasing Mekki when she came over to talk. This is really childish logic, but the old rule says you only tease people you like."
    oliver "How big is the writing club?"
    heather "Not extremely."

    show heather skeptical

    heather "... A while ago."
    "Okay, I think I can spin this into something. If she's teasing Mekki and enjoys seeing her reactions and we're going by that old rule,"
    "Heather probably is a close friend of Mekkis, or enjoys her company. Something like that. If that's irrelevant and this whole thing is a lie, then the only thing I can think of is that she's trying to scare me away for some reason."
    "Now lets see if I can say that without making a fool of myself."
    oliver "Well, either you have some strange need for Mekki's attention which you wouldn't get if she was attending to some newcomer, or you're trying to protect the club by testing new people and scaring them away if you think they might be bad for the club."
    oliver "One's selfish and one isn't as much, but both are probably hurting the club."
    heather "So, which is it?"
    oliver "I don't think which it is matters, really. I have no choice. I have to pick one of them."
    oliver "If I pick the writing club, I'm going to pick it and she's going to help me pass my class. That's the deal. I don't need someone like you trying to undermine that, so-"
